This project aims to compare several regularization techniques for diabetic retinopathy detection using the VGG16 and ResNet-50 architectures

The "main.ipynb" file contains models for each architecture with unsampled data (all data will be used), while models trained using sampled data can be seen in the "sampling" folder with 700 images on each class.
